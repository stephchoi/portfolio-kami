In 2016, this girl graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry. After much deliberation I wasn't sure if chemistry was the field for me and struggled while trying to figure out what I wanted to do.

It was purely by chance that I came to web development. I'd been reading a couple of news articles online when I'd come across one about coding bootcamps. And I had a thought- "Maybe I could do that."

I'd taken a couple of free online coding courses to make sure that I didn't absolutely hate the field and discovered, to my pleasure, that I really enjoyed creating applications and websites and the like much more than I did mixing chemicals in the lab. So I switched career tracks to become a Web Developer.
