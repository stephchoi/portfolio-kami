title: My Bloc Experience
---
As someone who has never even looked at any form of coding before starting my time at Bloc, I was worried about a lot of different things going in. How difficult would learning the different languages be? How much do I need to know to be a "successful web developer"? Can I even learn to code?

So far, having only finished the Frontend Development portion of the Bloc Curriculum, most of my questions have been answered one way or another whether through the module instruction, trial and error, or my mentor. The difficulty of learning a coding language depends on the language. In general the basics are the easiest and as you build more upon them, the more complicated and more difficult the language is. A "successful web developer" doesn't necessarily need to know everything about coding(since it's impossible), they just need to be able to work through the frustration and the mistakes and be open to learning the new tricks. Well, if I couldn't learn to code I wouldn't have gotten to this point right?

And to be quite honest I still have quite a few concerns about the future, considering that I haven't yet started learning the Backend Development portion. But if it's anything like my experience so far, with a lot of staring at my computer screen and bothering my mentor, I'll probably be fine. (An apology in advance to the future backend development mentor.)
