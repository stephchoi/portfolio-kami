title: Finally Done (but not really)
---

After six months of being in this online coding bootcamp, I'm at the end of the road. It was tough and stressful but I found I had a lot of fun making my own webpage, applications, etc. (I'll probably write a separate blog on those sometime down the road when I feel like they're a little bit more finished, so I won't spend too much time on that.)

It's weird to think that I've graduated from a program because it's not like in high school or college where there's a definitive boundary between when you were in the program and when you weren't. There's no fanfare, no pomp and circumstance -just a new project or maybe a new job but absolutely more coding. It's an end that really isn't an end.

But like with every graduation there's always some anxiety for the future. Because there's always some unknown variable that you cannot control when you throw yourself into different situations. (And here is the point where some teacher in high school would quote something from *Oh the Places You'll Go* by Dr. Seuss, which while inspiring does not necessarily give you the answers and/or reassurance you were particularly looking for.)

The best thing anyone can do really is their own personal hardest. And so that's what I'm going to be doing. Wish me luck (and I'll send some your way too)!
