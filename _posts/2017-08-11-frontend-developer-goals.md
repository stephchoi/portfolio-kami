title: What to Do When Stuck
---
So you're stuck on a problem. You've already gone and Googled any possible solutions without any luck. And you're just dying from the frustration of working over and over again without any real progress. So you post your problem on Stack Overflow to ask the wise masses for their input. You don't just want to laze around waiting like a damsel in distress, do you? No, you want to be self-sufficient. But to even think about working through the problem brings so much stress you think your hair will fall out.

Fret not! For I shall tell you what you can do in the meantime to relax and prep for round two of the fight against the problem.

**Option 1.** Take a break. Maybe watch a video or two on Youtube or go for a walk. I find that when I get stuck sometimes I just end up working on the same part of the code when the problem is really in a different section of the project. My thought process is pretty linear, so I adjust small things here and there one at a time to see what works and what does absolutely nothing. Which may seem like a good method of bug-fixing until you're in your 58th attempt at fixing the problem and you still haven't figured out what's wrong and where the problem is.

Taking a break helps get my mind away from the mental block - kind of like a mental step backwards. It resets my thinking so that I take into account the entire application/webpage rather than the tiny portion that I kept working on. That way whenever I get back into the problem I can approach it in a different way from before.

If you like exercise (I do not), working out or going for a run or whatever physical activity you enjoy can help you get the stress out while also keeping you in better shape. Just don't overdo it. You still want to have the energy to tackle your problem, don't you?

**Option 2.** Eat a snack. Or a meal, if it's that time. You can have a healthy snack or one that's awful for you - whatever really fits your fancy. (I tend towards some dark chocolate for my brain food, but it's not for everyone.) Your brain proportionally consumes a lot of energy to maintain its functions. Basically for how small it is, it burns through a decent amount of the calories you consume throughout the day in comparison to the amount that the rest of your body does. So a brain block could just be a matter of needing a little more fuel to keep the cogs turning.

And the process of making food (if you *can* cook anyways) might actually be somewhat calming. Personally I love to bake, even if I have to battle with the scale for days after that, and I find the process of mixing all of that yummy butter and sugar and sometimes chocolate weirdly soothing. After you get everything in the oven you could always have another go at tackling the code again. Even if you don't figure it out, you always have some delectable treats waiting for you. Just make sure to set a timer so you don't burn the goodies. 

**Option 3.** Sleep. Doesn't matter if it's noon or midnight, just plop your head down on a pillow and catch some Z's. It's hard to think when you're tired. Your brain is slower, clouded. You're a little bit crankier. So instead of trying to work though the project at 3 AM, go to sleep and work on it in the morning. While you sleep your brain goes through the events of the day and reorganizes your memories and thoughts. So you might even find that you've solved the problem when you wake up.
