Currently I've completed most of the Frontend Development curriculum at Bloc: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Angular. The more I learn, the more I think, "What I wouldn't do to go back to the first steps of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."

Seriously, the further down this Web Development Path I go the rockier it gets. Learning HTML and CSS were pretty straightforward. CodeAcademy basically held my hand and guided me through HTML, CSS, JS, and Git with online lessons and examples to work through. And despite its glitches here and there, I find it's a great tool for laying down the foundation for everything else Bloc teaches further down the line.

Of course at the time it may be confusing to learn something (like Git) without completely understanding how it's used. That's where the whole "learning by doing" thing comes in. Bloc basically guides you through creating a webpage and an app so that you can understand how everything comes together, while teaching JQuery and later on Angular. The directions in the beginning are very simple. *Put this in the index file. Type this code into the main.css file. Make this file and put this into it and it will do this.* It's a foolproof way to make sure the website is at very least built properly.  

Yes, the hand-holding made me feel a bit like a child learning how to ride a bike and the parent just won't let go of the seat but trust me, it's rough when the training wheels are off. Trying to decipher the directions can in and of itself be the toughest challenge. I've had a couple of problems where I misunderstood what it was Bloc was looking for and spent at least an hour just going in circles because the JS code just wasn't working in the way I thought it should've.

In Angular it's especially difficult to figure out where the problem is because there are so many different components to it. The code might not even throw any errors, so you have to dig for the root of the problem blindly. For example, and alert should pop up on a button click but nothing happens. No error messages. Just a whole lot of nothing. Is the problem in the controller, the actual app, the directive? Is it just a typo? Is the function even being called properly?

Thank the heavens for Chris, my wonderful mentor, who graces me with the answers to all of my frustrated and/or confused questions. Without him I never would have made it this far. Literally. I probably would've gone bald from frustration because I'd still be stuck for three weeks on the same problem without any inkling of *why*.JS was a bit more difficult to grasp but still workable.
