# Explanation

  Bloc Jams is a music streaming application built with an AngularJS framework.

# Features

The entire website is media responsive. Depending on the size of the screen the layout of the webpage changes slightly to make it more user friendly. Home page - collection - album

The collection template displays all of the albums currently in the database of the application with album art, album title, artist name, and release date.

When you click on the cover art, the page is redirected to the album template. This holds the entire list of songs within the album as well as the fixed playback bar on the bottom of the screen, where you can play, pause, skip, and adjust the volume of the song.

Hovering over the song number on the album converts the number into a play button.

# Shortcomings

Obviously this application doesn't quite have the breadth of music that any user would want to have in their music streaming application. It has an Angular framework but no real database/ back-end support to make it a widely used and musically varied application.

However, as a whole there's a potential to build on the framework set. Currently the application only has one album within it's collection that's shown repeatedly in this format in order to mimic how a multi-album collection would look like. This way, if in the future we'd like to add more albums to the database, we won't have to worry about formatting the collections page, the wireframe for it is there.

There are some bugs that still need fixing. AKA dragging the seek bar vs clicking on the seek bar and what it does for the music.

 # Conclusions

As a whole, the application is solid. It does what it needs to with what it has. And there's potential for future expansion if desired. Practically if I were to expand way beyond tens of albums, there would obviously need to have a much better method for displaying the music collection, perhaps allowing for searches of album titles or authors. But for a first project I would say it is rather successful.
